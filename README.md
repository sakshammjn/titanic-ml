# Titanic Machine Learning Internship Assessment

This repository contains the implementation of two classic machine learning algorithms — **Naive Bayes** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** — applied to the Titanic dataset.

## Assessment Overview

- The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, fare, class, etc.
- Both algorithms are implemented **from scratch** using Python with **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.
- No machine learning libraries like scikit-learn have been used for the model implementation.
- The notebook includes:
  - Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
  - Exploratory data visualization.
  - Implementation of Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers.
  - Model evaluation with accuracy scores.
  - Explanations of each step in markdown cells.

## Files

- `Titanic_Project.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full code, markdown explanations, visualizations, and results.

## Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run all cells sequentially.
